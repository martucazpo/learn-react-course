## react-clicker

This is just a react-clicker that I did as part of another tutorial called *Learn React Course* by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw). This was also an excersize in linking my repository with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This is the counter [deployed](https://nervous-roentgen-dd92d3.netlify.com/). The counter is done with both classes and hooks and can toggle between green and red.
